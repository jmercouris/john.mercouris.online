Hi, my name is John Mercouris. I'm a software engineer with a
passion for developing high quality human interfaces. The projects and
research I work on center around the idea that we can make interactions
with our programs beautiful, and logically beautiful. To that end I
strongly believe that:

    Aesthetic integrity doesn’t measure the beauty of an app’s artwork
    or characterize its style; rather, it represents how well an app’s
    appearance and behavior integrates with its function to send a
    coherent message.

*Apple Human Interface Guidelines*

By empirically analyzing, understanding, and abstracting the constraints
of our machines and applications, we can create deep clarity in
interface and functionality.
